For the first version I decided to concentrate my efforts in electronic and software, for this I bought a cheap robot platform for mechanical platform (this one).</p>\n<p>I gave to myself some goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make a WiFi connected robot</li>\n<li>Make use of websockets for the control interface</li>\n<li>Make the robot speech</li>\n<li>Use some simple form of shape recognition</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I made many projects based on Arduino but this time I looked for something more powerful, looking in my “stuff drawer” I found a beaglebone (white one) and I choose her for the brain of the robot.</p>\n<p>BeagleBone is an incredible platform, it can run various OS like Arch Linux (default), Ubuntu and many others. One thing that made BeagleBone a little “special” compared to others it’s expansions capabilities (65 GPIO, 8 PWM, 7 Analog input, …) and a feature I found only in this board : PRU.</p>\n<p>PRU is acronym for Programmable Realtime Unit, BeagleBone has two of them. Essentially PRU are autonomous chip with a specific assembly instruction set capable of performing realtime task, they run separately from main OS but can communicate with it using shared memory.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 686px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/ec19f6738ab9488c9ebb84099343f91a/f6386/robot-image1.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 67.3828125%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"PRU-ICSS\"\n        title=\"PRU-ICSS\"\n        src=\"/static/ec19f6738ab9488c9ebb84099343f91a/f6386/robot-image1.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/ec19f6738ab9488c9ebb84099343f91a/01e7c/robot-image1.png 512w,\n/static/ec19f6738ab9488c9ebb84099343f91a/f6386/robot-image1.png 686w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>PRU are essential to make tasks with high precision time constraints, like make a pulse wave modulation or, as in my case, to read short pulse from a <a href=\"http://learn.parallax.com/kickstart/28015\">PING)))</a> sensor.</p>\n<p>PING))) sensor from parallax is cheap and theoretically really simple to use, this is true for example with Arduino but using it with BeagleBone make things a bit more difficult. This sensor works emitting an ultrasonic signal when the board send a short signal on trigger pin (40Khz), to misure distance board have to read the echo response duration. Here is where things get complicated.</p>\n<p>Using a GPIO to read an hight frequency signal and pretend to precisely measure it is really optimistic. Isn’t a hardware problem but more a software one. GPIO on BeagleBone are handled by operating system (Linux), this is not a realtime OS so software scheduler can’t grant a precise response time to an hardware event.</p>\n<p>In a next post I’ll show how to use PRU in BeagleBone, stay tuned!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Making a simple robot","date":"November 02, 2013","tags":["python"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/making-a-simple-robot/"}}}
